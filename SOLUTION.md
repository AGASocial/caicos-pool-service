### 2.3 Data Flow

**Technician Workflow:**
```
1. Technician logs in (Multi-tenant auth)
   ↓
2. Dashboard shows assigned jobs for today
   ↓
3. Opens job → sees customer details, property info, gate codes
   ↓
4. Starts job (status: pending → in_progress)
   ↓
5. Fills service form:
   - Chemical readings
   - Equipment checks
   - Tasks completed
   - Photos (before/after/issues)
   - Notes
   ↓
6. Marks complete (status → completed)
   ↓
7. Syncs to Supabase (with photos)
```

**Admin Workflow:**
```
1. Admin logs in (Web portal)
   ↓
2. Dashboard: See team, jobs, properties
   ↓
3. Can create/edit:
   - Customer properties
   - Service jobs
   - Technician assignments
   ↓
4. View reports & trends
   ↓
5. Manage company settings
```

profiles           # Users (extends auth.users)
├── id, company_id, role, full_name, avatar_url

properties         # Customer pools
├── id, company_id, customer_name, address, pool_type

service_jobs       # Scheduled visits
├── id, company_id, property_id, technician_id, scheduled_date, status

service_reports    # Completed work
├── id, job_id, company_id, technician_id
├── [chemical readings: ph_level, chlorine_level, ...]
├── [equipment: pump_ok, filter_ok, ...]
├── [tasks: skimmed, vacuumed, brushed, ...]
├── notes, follow_up_needed

report_photos      # Attachments
├── id, report_id, company_id, storage_path, photo_type
```

### Security:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Policies: Users see only their company data
- Multi-tenant isolation at database level
- Admin-only operations restricted via role checks

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Photo upload failures | Service report incomplete | Implement retry logic + offline queue |
| RLS misconfiguration | Data breach | Thorough testing of policies + audit logs |
| Schema scaling | Performance degradation | Index on company_id, scheduled_date |
| Offline data conflict | Data consistency | Last-write-wins + server validation |
| Technician adoption | Low usage | Simple UX, training, in-app guidance |

---

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Clarify requirements:**
   - Specific chemical readings for Caicos pools?
   - Any integrations (QuickBooks, Stripe)?
   - Branding requirements?

2. **Detailed feature specs:**
   - Create separate docs for each major feature
   - Wireframes for key screens
   - API endpoint specifications

3. **Development kickoff:**
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Initialize git repos
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines

4. **Timeline estimation:**
   - Technician app core: 4-6 weeks
   - Admin portal core: 3-4 weeks
